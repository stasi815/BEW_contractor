What you’re going to create:

I a going to create an app that my spiritual community can use to create and organize prayer circles and ceremonies. The main model will be Ceremony - with fields that include what to wear, what to bring, time and date, description and location. There will be a login step that will allow authenticated users to add events and send them to the group. The views will be: an index page that shows all of the events, an event detail page and a new event form.

Why it’s useful:

This app is useful because in my community we don't have a resource like this one to work with to plan our events.
